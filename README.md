# README Generator

## Description
The README Generator is a Node.js command-line application designed to help developers quickly create professional README.md files for their GitHub projects. Using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), the application prompts users for key project details, such as the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact information. It then dynamically generates a well-structured README file with the following sections:

- **Title**: The project name, displayed as a heading.
- **Description**: A summary of the projectâ€™s purpose and functionality.
- **Table of Contents**: Clickable links to navigate to each section.
- **Installation**: Steps to install the project.
- **Usage**: Instructions for using the project.
- **License**: A badge and description of the chosen license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- **Tests**: Instructions for running tests.
- **Questions**: Contact details, including GitHub username and email.

This tool saves developers time by automating the creation of high-quality READMEs, ensuring consistency and professionalism while allowing customization through user input.
